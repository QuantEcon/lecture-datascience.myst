    "## File Formats\n",
    "\n",
    "Data can be saved in a variety of formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "pandas understands how to write and read DataFrames to and from many of\n",
    "these formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "We defer to the [official\n",
    "documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/io.html)\n",
    "for a full description of how to interact with all the file formats, but\n",
    "will briefly discuss a few of them here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CSV\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is it?** CSVs store data as plain text (strings) where each row is a\n",
    "line and columns are separated by `,`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Widely used (you should be familiar with it)\n",
    "- Plain text file (can open on any computer, \"future proof\")\n",
    "- Can be read from and written to by most data software\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Not the most efficient way to store or access\n",
    "- No formal standard, so there is room for user interpretation on how to\n",
    "  handle edge cases (e.g. what to do about a data field that itself includes\n",
    "  a comma)\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A great default option for most use cases\n",
    "\n",
    "### xlsx\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is it?** xlsx is a binary file format used as Excel's default.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Standard format in many industries\n",
    "- Easy to share with colleagues that use Excel\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Quite slow to read/write large amounts of data\n",
    "- Stores both data and *metadata* like styling and display information\n",
    "  and even plots. This metadata is not always portable to other file formats\n",
    "  or programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When sharing data with Excel\n",
    "- When you would like special formatting to be applied to the\n",
    "  spreadsheet when viewed in Excel\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parquet\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is it?** Parquet is a custom binary format designed for efficient reading and\n",
    "writing of data stored in columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Very* fast\n",
    "- Naturally understands all `dtypes` used by pandas, including\n",
    "  multi-index DataFrames\n",
    "- Very common in \"big data\" systems like Hadoop or Spark\n",
    "- Supports various compression algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Binary storage format that is not human-readable\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you have \"not small\" amounts (> 100 MB) of unchanging data that\n",
    "  you want to read quickly\n",
    "- If you want to store data in an size-and-time-efficient way that may\n",
    "  be accessed by external systems\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feather\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is it?** Feather is a custom binary format designed for efficient reading and\n",
    "writing of data stored in columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Very* fast -- even faster than parquet\n",
    "- Naturally understands all `dtypes` used by pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can only read and write from Python and a handful of other\n",
    "  programming languages\n",
    "- New file format (introduced in March '16), so most files don't come\n",
    "  in this format\n",
    "- Only supports standard pandas index, so you need to `reset_index`\n",
    "  before saving and then `set_index` after loading\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use as an alternative to Parquet if you need the absolute best read and write\n",
    "  speeds for unchanging datasets\n",
    "- Only use when you will not need to access the data in a programming language\n",
    "  or software outside of Python, R, and Julia\n",
    "\n",
    "### SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is it?** SQL is a language used to interact with relational\n",
    "databases... [more info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Well established industry standard for handling data\n",
    "- Much of the world's data is in a SQL database somewhere\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Complicated: to have full control you need to learn another language\n",

    "\n",
    "**When to use**:\n",

    "## Writing DataFrames\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now talk about saving a DataFrame to a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a general rule of thumb, if we have a DataFrame `df` and we would\n",
    "like to save to save it as a file of type `FOO`, then we would call\n",

    "documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need some DataFrames to save. Let's make them now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that by default `df2` will be approximately 10 MB.\n",
