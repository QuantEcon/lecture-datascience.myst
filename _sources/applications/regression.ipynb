    "## Introduction to Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of regression analysis is to provide accurate mapping from one or\n",
    "more input variables (called features in machine learning or exogenous\n",
    "variables in econometrics) to a continuous output variable (called the label or\n",
    "target in machine learning and the endogenous variable in\n",
    "econometrics).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we will study some of the most fundamental and widely-used\n",
    "regression algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will follow this same general pattern when we learn each algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Describe the mathematical foundation for the algorithm\n",
