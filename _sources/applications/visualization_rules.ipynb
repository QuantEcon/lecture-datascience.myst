    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "An economist's (or data scientist's) job goes beyond simply learning new things using data and\n",
    "theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning these new things is meant to help economists or data scientists communicate these ideas to others,\n",
    "whether the medium is an academic paper or a business meeting.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most effective mediums of communication is visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well-done visualizations can help your audience remember your message.\n",
    "\n",
    "They accomplish this through at least two main channels:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Psychology researchers have observed [*picture superiority*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picture_superiority_effect): the fact that images are more likely to be remembered than\n",
    "words. While the reasons and extent of the effect are debated, the consensus view is that the effect exists.\n",
    "How large might this effect be? In a paper by Defeyter, Russo, and McPartlin (2009), the authors found that participants were able to identify pictures they had previously studied for approximately 500 ms each with 75-85% accuracy but words with only a 55-65% accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data visualizations help people walk through the logic you used to build the chart,\n",
    "   allowing them to reason through the argument and thus makes your claim more convincing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we will discuss the process of creating a data visualization, ways to best ensure\n",
    "successfully communication, and some general design guidelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along the way, you will be introduced to many features of `matplotlib` that were not discussed in the\n",
    "introductory lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't discuss most of these features, but we encourage you to read more in the\n",
    "[online documentation](https://matplotlib.org/contents.html) if you have questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps to Creating Effective Charts\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin discussions of specific recommendations, it is helpful to agree on\n",
    "the goal of a data visualization and a process that can be used to accomplish the goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the introduction, the purpose of a visualization is to facilitate the communication\n",
    "of a message or idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have found the following steps to be useful for achieving this goal:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify the message.\n",
    "1. Describe your visualization.\n",
    "1. Create a draft of the visualization (and verify your data!).\n",
    "1. Fine tune the visualization details.\n",
    "\n",
    "After discussing the role research plays in data visualization, we will use an example to provide\n",
    "deeper context for the remaining steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 0: Research**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we proceed, note that prior to reaching this process, you will have spent\n",
    "a significant amount of time exploring the data and thinking about your overall message.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, during the research step, you will almost certainly produce visualizations to help yourself\n",
    "understand the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "These visualizations can highlight outliers or unlikely combinations of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, NYC publishes data on taxi pickups and dropoffs.\n",
    "\n",
    "One might expect tips to be somewhat independent of whether someone pays cash or credit, but\n",
    "the 75th percentile tip for cash payers is 0!\n",
    "\n",
    "Because it's unlikely that cash payers choose not to tip, one likely explanation\n",
    "is a reporting issue in the data collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps and guidelines that follow may be helpful in the research process, but refining each of your exploratory visualizations to a publishable version is not practical.\n",
    "Some of these recommendations will be specific to creating a visualization after you understand the story you're telling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of this example will be a reproduction of a visualization from\n",
    "[this NYT article](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/upshot/big-cities-low-skilled-workers-wages.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "This NYT article is based on research done by David Autor [^ely] , an\n",
    "economist at MIT, and his co-authors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Autor's research investigates the observable changes over time between work opportunities\n",
    "in rural and urban locations in the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "This particular graph explores how both college-educated workers and non-college-educated workers were able\n",
    "to find higher-paying jobs by working in urban areas in the 20th century.\n",
    "\n",
    "More recently, this *city wage premium* is still apparent for those\n",
    "with college educations. However, for those without a college education, it has\n",
    "disappeared.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Identify the Message\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step to creating a visualization might feel a little obvious, but is\n",
    "the most important step.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you fail to choose a concise message, then you won't be able to clearly communicate the idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we want people to be able to answer the question, \"What happened to the\n",
    "rural/urban wage gap for non-college-educated workers since the 1950s?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of what makes the answer interesting is that the wage gap changes are unique to non-college-educated workers; we will want to display changes in the wage gap for college-educated workers as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Visualize\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing the type of visualization that best illustrates your point is an important\n",
    "skill to develop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the wrong type of visualization can inhibit the flow of information from the\n",
    "graph to your audience's brain.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we need to display the relationship between population density (our measure of\n",
    "rural/urban) and wages for different years and education levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the wage gap will be the main focus, we want to choose a visualization that highlights\n",
    "this aspect of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scatter plots are one of the most effective ways to demonstrate the relationship of two\n",
    "variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will place the log of population density on the x-axis and the log of wages on the y-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will then need to find a way to demonstrate this for different years and education levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "One natural solution is to demonstrate one of these variables using color and the other using\n",
    "different subplots.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the original article, they chose to highlight differences in college\n",
    "education using color and time using subplots.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Visualization Draft\n",
    "\n",
    "Drafting an early version of your visualization without concerning yourself about its aesthetics allows you to think about whether it is able to answer the proposed question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you'll get to this step and realize that you need to go back to one of the previous\n",
    "steps...\n",
    "\n",
    "It's ok to scrap what you have and restart at square one.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, you will frequently do this, no matter how much experience you've developed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our own work, we've found that it's not uncommon to discard ten or more versions of a graph before\n",
    "settling on a draft we are happy with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we create a draft of our plot."
