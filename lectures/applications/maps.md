## Mapping in Python

In this lecture, we will use a new package, `geopandas`, to create maps.

Maps are really quite complicated... We are trying to project a spherical surface onto a flat figure, which is an
inherently complicated endeavor.

Luckily, `geopandas` will do most of the heavy lifting for us.

Let's start with a DataFrame that has the latitude and longitude coordinates of various South American cities.

Our goal is to turn them into something we can plot -- in this case, a `GeoDataFrame`.

```{code-cell} python
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'City': ['Buenos Aires', 'Brasilia', 'Santiago', 'Bogota', 'Caracas'],
    'Country': ['Argentina', 'Brazil', 'Chile', 'Colombia', 'Venezuela'],
    'Latitude': [-34.58, -15.78, -33.45, 4.60, 10.48],
    'Longitude': [-58.66, -47.91, -70.66, -74.08, -66.86]
})
```

In order to map the cities, we need tuples of coordinates.

We generate them by zipping the latitude and longitude together to store them in a new column named `Coordinates`.

```{code-cell} python
df["Coordinates"] = list(zip(df.Longitude, df.Latitude))
df.head()
```

Our next step is to turn the tuple into a `Shapely` `Point` object.

We will do this by applying Shapely's `Point` method to the `Coordinates` column.

```{code-cell} python
df["Coordinates"] = df["Coordinates"].apply(Point)
df.head()
```

Finally, we will convert our DataFrame into a GeoDataFrame by calling the
geopandas.DataFrame method.

Conveniently, a GeoDataFrame is a data structure with the convenience of a
normal DataFrame but also an understanding of how to plot maps.

In the code below, we must specify the column that contains the geometry data.

See this excerpt from the docs

> The most important property of a GeoDataFrame is that it always has one GeoSeries column that
> holds a special status. This GeoSeries is referred to as the GeoDataFrame’s “geometry”. When a
> spatial method is applied to a GeoDataFrame (or a spatial attribute like area is called), this
> commands will always act on the “geometry” column.

```{code-cell} python
gdf = gpd.GeoDataFrame(df, geometry="Coordinates")
gdf.head()
```

```{code-cell} python
# Doesn't look different than a vanilla DataFrame...let's make sure we have what we want
print('gdf is of type:', type(gdf))

# And how can we tell which column is the geometry column?
print('\nThe geometry column is:', gdf.geometry.name)
```

### Plotting a Map

Great, now we have our points in the GeoDataFrame.

Let's plot the locations on a map.

This will require 3 steps

1. Get the map
1. Plot the map
1. Plot the points (our cities) on the map

#### 1. Get the map

An organization called [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/) compiled the map data
that we use here.

The file provides the outlines of countries, over which we'll plot the city locations
from our GeoDataFrame.

Luckily, `geopandas` already comes bundled with this data, so we don't
have to hunt it down!

```{code-cell} python
# Grab low resolution world file
world = gpd.read_file(gpd.datasets.get_path("naturalearth_lowres"))
world = world.set_index("iso_a3")

world.head()
```

`world` is a GeoDataFrame with the following columns:

* `pop_est`: Contains a population estimate for the country
* `continent`: The country's continent
* `name`: The country's name
* `iso_a3`: The country's 3 letter abbreviation (we made this the index)
* `gdp_md_est`: An estimate of country's GDP
* `geometry`: A `POLYGON` for each country (we will learn more about these soon)

```{code-cell} python
world.geometry.name
```

Notice that the geometry for this GeoDataFrame is stored in the `geometry` column.

**A quick note about polygons**

Instead of points (as our cities are), the geometry objects are now polygons.

A polygon is what you already likely think it is -- a collection of ordered points
connected by straight lines.

The smaller the distance between the points, the more readily the polygon can approximate
non-linear shapes.

Let's see an example of a polygon.

```{code-cell} python
world.loc["ALB", 'geometry']
```

Notice that it displayed the country of Albania.

```{code-cell} python
# Returns two arrays that hold the x and y coordinates of the points that define the polygon's exterior.
x, y = world.loc["ALB", "geometry"].exterior.coords.xy

# How many points?
print('Points in the exterior of Albania:', len(x))
```

Let's see another

```{code-cell} python
world.loc["AFG", "geometry"]
```

```{code-cell} python
# Returns two arrays that hold the x and y coordinates of the points that define the polygon's exterior.
x, y = world.loc["AFG", 'geometry'].exterior.coords.xy

# How many points?
print('Points in the exterior of Afghanistan:', len(x))
```

Notice that we've now displayed Afghanistan.

This is a more complex shape than Albania and thus required more points.

#### 2. Plotting the map

```{code-cell} python
fig, gax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10,10))

# By only plotting rows in which the continent is 'South America' we only plot SA.
world.query("continent == 'South America'").plot(ax=gax, edgecolor='black',color='white')

# By the way, if you haven't read the book 'longitude' by Dava Sobel, you should...
gax.set_xlabel('longitude')
gax.set_ylabel('latitude')

gax.spines['top'].set_visible(False)
gax.spines['right'].set_visible(False)

plt.show()
```

Creating this map may have been easier than you expected!

In reality, a lot of heavy lifting is going on behind the scenes.

Entire university classes (and even majors!) focus on the theory and thought
that goes into creating maps, but, for now, we are happy to rely on the work done by the
experts behind `geopandas` and its related libraries.

#### 3. Plot the cities

In the code below, we run the same commands as before to plot the South American countries, but
, now, we also plot the data in `gdf`, which contains the location of South American cities.

```{code-cell} python
# Step 3: Plot the cities onto the map
# We mostly use the code from before --- we still want the country borders plotted --- and we
# add a command to plot the cities
fig, gax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10,10))

# By only plotting rows in which the continent is 'South America' we only plot, well,
# South America.
world.query("continent == 'South America'").plot(ax = gax, edgecolor='black', color='white')

# This plot the cities. It's the same syntax, but we are plotting from a different GeoDataFrame.
# I want the cities as pale red dots.
gdf.plot(ax=gax, color='red', alpha = 0.5)

gax.set_xlabel('longitude')
gax.set_ylabel('latitude')
gax.set_title('South America')

gax.spines['top'].set_visible(False)
gax.spines['right'].set_visible(False)

plt.show()
```

**Adding labels to points**.

Finally, we might want to consider annotating the cities so we know which cities are which.

```{code-cell} python
# Step 3: Plot the cities onto the map
# We mostly use the code from before --- we still want the country borders plotted --- and we add a command to plot the cities
fig, gax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10,10))

# By only plotting rows in which the continent is 'South America' we only plot, well, South America.
world.query("continent == 'South America'").plot(ax = gax, edgecolor='black', color='white')

# This plot the cities. It's the same syntax, but we are plotting from a different GeoDataFrame. I want the
# cities as pale red dots.
gdf.plot(ax=gax, color='red', alpha = 0.5)

gax.set_xlabel('longitude')
gax.set_ylabel('latitude')
gax.set_title('South America')

# Kill the spines...
gax.spines['top'].set_visible(False)
gax.spines['right'].set_visible(False)

# ...or get rid of all the axis. Is it important to know the lat and long?
# plt.axis('off')


# Label the cities
for x, y, label in zip(gdf['Coordinates'].x, gdf['Coordinates'].y, gdf['City']):
    gax.annotate(label, xy=(x,y), xytext=(4,4), textcoords='offset points')

plt.show()
```

## Case Study: Voting in Wisconsin

In the example that follows, we will demonstrate how each county in Wisconsin voted during the 2016
Presidential Election.

Along the way, we will learn a couple of valuable lessons:

1. Where to find shape files for US states and counties
1. How to match census style data to shape files

### Find and Plot State Border

Our first step will be to find the border for the state of interest. This can be found on the [US
Census's website here](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html).

You can download the `cb_2016_us_state_5m.zip` by hand, or simply allow `geopandas` to extract
the relevant information from the zip file online.

```{code-cell} python
state_df = gpd.read_file("https://datascience.quantecon.org/assets/data/cb_2016_us_state_5m.zip")
state_df.head()
```

```{code-cell} python
print(state_df.columns)
```

We have various columns, but, most importantly, we can find the right geometry by filtering by name.

```{code-cell} python
fig, gax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 10))
state_df.query("NAME == 'Wisconsin'").plot(ax=gax, edgecolor="black", color="white")
plt.show()
```

### Find and Plot County Borders

Next, we will add the county borders to our map.

The county shape files (for the entire US) can be found on the [Census
site](https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/cbf/cbf_counties.html).

Once again, we will use the 5m resolution.

```{code-cell} python
county_df = gpd.read_file("https://datascience.quantecon.org/assets/data/cb_2016_us_county_5m.zip")
county_df.head()
```

```{code-cell} python
print(county_df.columns)
```

Wisconsin's FIPS code is 55 so we will make sure that we only keep those counties.

```{code-cell} python
county_df = county_df.query("STATEFP == '55'")
```

Now we can plot all counties in Wisconsin.

```{code-cell} python
fig, gax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 10))

state_df.query("NAME == 'Wisconsin'").plot(ax=gax, edgecolor="black", color="white")
county_df.plot(ax=gax, edgecolor="black", color="white")

plt.show()
```

### Get Vote Data

The final step is to get the vote data, which can be found online on [this site](https://elections.wi.gov/elections-voting/results/2016/fall-general).

Our friend Kim says,

> Go ahead and open up the file. It's a mess! I saved a cleaned up version of the file to
> `results.csv` which we can use to save the hassle with cleaning the data. For fun, you should
> load the raw data and try beating it into shape. That's what you normally would have to do...
> and it's fun.

We'd like to add that such an exercise is also "good for you" (similar to how vegetables are good for you).

But, for the example in class, we'll simply start with his cleaned data.

```{code-cell} python
results = pd.read_csv("https://datascience.quantecon.org/assets/data/ruhl_cleaned_results.csv", thousands=",")
results.head()
```

Notice that this is NOT a GeoDataFrame; it has no geographical information.

But it does have the names of each county.

We will be able to use this to match to the counties from `county_df`.

First, we need to finish up the data cleaning.

```{code-cell} python
results["county"] = results["county"].str.title()
results["county"] = results["county"].str.strip()
county_df["NAME"] = county_df["NAME"].str.title()
county_df["NAME"] = county_df["NAME"].str.strip()
```

Then, we can merge election results with the county data.

```{code-cell} python
res_w_states = county_df.merge(results, left_on="NAME", right_on="county", how="inner")
```

Next, we'll create a new variable called `trump_share`, which will denote the percentage of votes that
Donald Trump won during the election.

```{code-cell} python
res_w_states["trump_share"] = res_w_states["trump"] / (res_w_states["total"])
res_w_states["rel_trump_share"] = res_w_states["trump"] / (res_w_states["trump"]+res_w_states["clinton"])
res_w_states.head()
```

Finally, we can create our map.

```{code-cell} python
fig, gax = plt.subplots(figsize = (10,8))

# Plot the state
state_df[state_df['NAME'] == 'Wisconsin'].plot(ax = gax, edgecolor='black',color='white')

# Plot the counties and pass 'rel_trump_share' as the data to color
res_w_states.plot(
    ax=gax, edgecolor='black', column='rel_trump_share', legend=True, cmap='RdBu_r',
    vmin=0.2, vmax=0.8
)

# Add text to let people know what we are plotting
gax.annotate('Republican vote share',xy=(0.76, 0.06),  xycoords='figure fraction')

# I don't want the axis with long and lat
plt.axis('off')

plt.show()
```

What do you see from this map?

How many counties did Trump win? How many did Clinton win?

```{code-cell} python
res_w_states.eval("trump > clinton").sum()
```

```{code-cell} python
res_w_states.eval("clinton > trump").sum()
```

Who had more votes? Do you think a comparison in counties won or votes won is more reasonable? Why
do you think they diverge?

```{code-cell} python
res_w_states["trump"].sum()
```

```{code-cell} python
res_w_states["clinton"].sum()
```

What story could you tell about this divergence?

### Interactivity

Multiple Python libraries can help create interactive figures.

Here, we will see an example using bokeh.

In the another lecture, we will see an example with folium.

```{code-cell} python
from bokeh.io import output_notebook
from bokeh.plotting import figure, ColumnDataSource
from bokeh.io import output_notebook, show, output_file
from bokeh.plotting import figure
from bokeh.models import GeoJSONDataSource, LinearColorMapper, ColorBar, HoverTool
from bokeh.palettes import brewer
output_notebook()
import json
res_w_states["clinton_share"] = res_w_states["clinton"] / res_w_states["total"]
#Convert data to geojson for bokeh
wi_geojson=GeoJSONDataSource(geojson=res_w_states.to_json())
```

```{code-cell} python
color_mapper = LinearColorMapper(palette = brewer['RdBu'][10], low = 0, high = 1)
color_bar = ColorBar(color_mapper=color_mapper, label_standoff=8,width = 500, height = 20,
                     border_line_color=None,location = (0,0), orientation = 'horizontal')
hover = HoverTool(tooltips = [ ('County','@county'),('Portion Trump', '@trump_share'),
                               ('Portion Clinton','@clinton_share'),
                               ('Total','@total')])
p = figure(title="Wisconsin Voting in 2016 Presidential Election", tools=[hover])
p.patches("xs","ys",source=wi_geojson,
          fill_color = {'field' :'rel_trump_share', 'transform' : color_mapper})
p.add_layout(color_bar, 'below')
show(p)
```
