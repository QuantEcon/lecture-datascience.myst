# This section of the workshop covers data ingestion, cleaning,
# manipulation, analysis, and visualization in Python.
# 
# We build on the skills learned in the {doc}`Python fundamentals <../python_fundamentals/index>` section and teach the
# [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) library.
# 
# At the end of this section, you will be able to:
# 
# - Access data stored in a variety of formats
# - Combine multiple datasets based on observations that link them
#   together
# - Perform custom operations on tables of data
# - Use the split-apply-combine method for analyzing sub-groups of data
# - Automate static analysis on changing data
# - Produce publication quality visualizations
# 
# In the end, our goal with this section is to provide you the
# necessary skills to -- at a minimum -- **immediately** replicate your current
# data analysis workflow in Python with no loss of total (computer +
# human) time.
# 
# This is a lower bound on the benefits you should expect to receive by
# studying this section.
# 
# The expression "practice makes perfect" is especially true here.
# 
# As you work with these tools, both the time to write and the time to run
# your programs will fall dramatically.
