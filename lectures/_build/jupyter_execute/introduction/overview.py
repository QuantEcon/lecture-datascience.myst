# # Course Description
# 
# ## Course Objectives and Scope
# 
# ### Scope of Lecture Notes
# 
# This course is a lecture series on data science, economics, programming, and how
# they can be used to understand the world around us.
# 
# We envision this as a complement to econometrics. We focus on learning practical programming
# skills for the workplace and future studies in economics and finance.
# 
# Unlike courses in computer science, data science, or statistics, the emphasis of this course
# includes both the programming and the statistics necessary to analyze data *and* subsequently
# interpret results through the lens of economics.
# 
# While anyone with the appropriate prerequisites will benefit from this course, undergraduate
# programs will find the lecture series suitable for 2nd to 3rd year students who have taken two
# calculus classes and their school's equivalent of Econ 101. No prior programming experience is
# required.
# 
# Students who complete this course will be prepared to:
# 
# * Work in a data analyst or a data science role with the ability to frame problems in a broader
#   economic context and provide unique insights associated with that context, and/or,
# * Continue onto QuantEcon's "Lectures in Quantitative Economics" in preparation for graduate school
#   in economics, policy, or other related fields.
# 
# To get an idea of what one can do after taking this course, please take a look at [previous student projects](../theme/projects.md).
# 
# ### Course Outline
# 
# The essential outcome of the course is: Students will be able to recognize and understand the
# connections between economic theory and the practice of data science, expanding beyond atheoretical
# statistical approaches.
# 
# The course is divided into three segments.
# 
# The first segment of this course covers programming and basic scientific computing in Python by
# re-examining basic Econ 101 concepts and models.
# 
# This provides a natural introduction to thinking of economics as a quantitative discipline, with
# principles and applications grounded in real world problems.
# 
# The second segment dives into data analysis and data science, with the associated data wrangling
# skills, as a way to leverage economic data, tools, and concepts.
# 
# The final segment is a sequence of case studies designed to help students answer specific questions
# and recommend solutions.
# 
# Students will learn and apply more advanced techniques and models, as well as examine new data sources.
# 
# ## Prerequisites
# 
# While we have kept the prerequisites to a minimum, some degree of mathematical fluency is required.
# 
# Most importantly, while familiarity with computers is expected, **no** programming knowledge is
# required for this course.
# 
# To summarize the background we expect that you should have at least: (1) an introductory "ECON 101"
# class; (2) one to two terms of calculus; and (3) either an elementary course in matrix algebra, or a
# willingness to learn the basics on your own.
# 
# ### Calculus
# 
# You should have one course (and possibly two, depending on your university) in Calculus.
# 
# The core concepts used throughout the lectures are
# 
# - Basic rules of differentiation of univariate functions (e.g. chain rule, product rule)
# - Exponentials, natural logarithms, and their derivatives
# - Inverse functions and implicit functions
# - Maximization/minimization of univariate functions
# - Sequences, series, and infinite series
# - Partial derivatives and multivariate functions
# - Unconstrained Minimization and maximization of multivariate functions
# - Simple constrained optimization (including Lagrange multipliers)
# 
# ### Linear Algebra
# 
# If you have not taken a first course in applied linear algebra or matrix algebra, you will need to
# learn concepts of
# 
# - Vectors and matrices
# - Matrices and systems of linear equations
# - Dimension and rank
# - Matrix operations (e.g. addition, multiplication, inverse)
# - Inner products
# - Least squares
# 
# ### Probability
# 
# Basic probability is sometimes covered in a second calculus course, but if you have never
# encountered the topics, then review
# 
# - Basic probability of discrete and continuous distributions
# - Conditional and marginal distributions
# - Expected value, variance, and standard deviation
# 
# ### Economics
# 
# While more economics is always better, we will try to assume an "Econ 101" background.
# 
# Otherwise, we will try to provide additional background material on the economics topics.
