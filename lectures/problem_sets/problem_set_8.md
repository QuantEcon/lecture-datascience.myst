# Problem Set 8

In this problem set, your goal is to train a model to best predict
log housing values. The criteria for best prediction is mean squared error.
The file ahs.csv contains data from the [American Housing
Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/ahs.html) . Your predictive model will be
graded based on another evaluation sample from the same survey.
You should create a function that returns the predictions of your model
when given an identically-formatted csv file with all the same variables.
(Your function should not refit your model on the evaluation sample.)
In addition, answer the questions below.

## Additional Rules

You may not use additional data from the American Housing Survey to
fit your model. You may use data from other sources (although this
is not necessary to receive a good grade). You may use methods not
covered in this course (although this is also not necessary to receive
a good grade).

```{code-cell} python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn import (
    linear_model, metrics, neural_network, pipeline,
    model_selection, tree
)
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
# load data
ahs = pd.read_csv("ahs-train.csv")
ahs.info()
```

```{code-cell} python
# dataframe of variable descriptions
ahs_doc = pd.read_csv("ahs-doc.csv", encoding="latin1")
with pd.option_context('display.max_rows', None, 'display.max_columns', None, 'max_colwidth', -1):
    display(ahs_doc[["Variable","Question","Description","Associated.Response.Codes"]])
```

### Question 1

Create exploratory table(s) and/or visualization(s) to check the data
and help make modelling choices. These need not be very polished.

### Question 2

What model will you use for prediction and why you
did you choose this model?

### Question 3

Briefly describe how you chose any regularization and other parameters
in your model.

### Question 4

What have you done to avoid overfitting?

### Question 5

Create a visualization to help evaluate of your model. This
visualization can be part of your answer to questions 2-4 or it
can simply summarize your model's predictive accuracy.

### Question 6

Create a function that returns the predictions of
your model when given an identically-formatted pandas DataFrame
(created from an identically formatted csv file by pd.read_csv)
with all the same variables. Your function should not refit your model on
the evaluation sample.
