```

## pandas

This lecture begins the material on `pandas`.

To start, we will import the pandas package and give it the alias
`pd`, which is conventional practice.

```{code-cell} python
import pandas as pd

# Don't worry about this line for now!
%matplotlib inline
```

Sometimes, knowing which pandas version we are
using is helpful.

We can check this by running the code below.

```{code-cell} python
pd.__version__
```

## Series

The first main pandas type we will introduce is called Series.

A Series is a single column of data, with row labels for each
observation.

pandas refers to the row labels as the *index* of the Series.

```{figure} ../_static/PandasSeries.png
:alt: PandasSeries.png
```

Below, we create a Series which contains the US unemployment rate every
other year starting in 1995.

```{code-cell} python
values = [5.6, 5.3, 4.3, 4.2, 5.8, 5.3, 4.6, 7.8, 9.1, 8., 5.7]
years = list(range(1995, 2017, 2))

unemp = pd.Series(data=values, index=years, name="Unemployment")
```

```{code-cell} python
unemp
```

We can look at the index and values in our Series.

```{code-cell} python
unemp.index
```

```{code-cell} python
unemp.values
```

### What Can We Do with a Series object?

#### `.head` and `.tail`

Often, our data will have many rows, and we won't want to display it all
at once.

The methods `.head` and `.tail` show rows at the beginning and end
of our Series, respectively.

```{code-cell} python
unemp.head()
```

```{code-cell} python
unemp.tail()
```

#### Basic Plotting

We can also plot data using the `.plot` method.

```{code-cell} python
unemp.plot()
```

```{note}
This is why we needed the `%matplotlib inline` — it tells the notebook
to display figures inside the notebook itself. Also, pandas has much greater visualization functionality than this, but we will study that later on.
```

#### Unique Values

Though it doesn't make sense in this data set, we may want to find the
unique values in a Series -- which can be done with the `.unique` method.

```{code-cell} python
unemp.unique()
```

#### Indexing

Sometimes, we will want to select particular elements from a Series.

We can do this using `.loc[index_items]`; where `index_items` is
an item from the index, or a list of items in the index.

We will see this more in-depth in a coming lecture, but for now, we
demonstrate how to select one or multiple elements of the Series.

```{code-cell} python
unemp.loc[1995]
```

```{code-cell} python
unemp.loc[[1995, 2005, 2015]]
```

## DataFrame

A DataFrame is how pandas stores one or more columns of data.

We can think a DataFrames a multiple Series stacked side by side as
columns.

This is similar to a sheet in an Excel workbook or a table in a SQL
database.

In addition to row labels (an index), DataFrames also have column labels.

We refer to these column labels as the columns or column names.

```{figure} ../_static/PandasDataFrame.png
:alt: PandasDataFrame.png
```

Below, we create a DataFrame that contains the unemployment rate every
other year by region of the US starting in 1995.

```{code-cell} python
data = {
    "NorthEast": [5.9,  5.6,  4.4,  3.8,  5.8,  4.9,  4.3,  7.1,  8.3,  7.9,  5.7],
    "MidWest": [4.5,  4.3,  3.6,  4. ,  5.7,  5.7,  4.9,  8.1,  8.7,  7.4,  5.1],
    "South": [5.3,  5.2,  4.2,  4. ,  5.7,  5.2,  4.3,  7.6,  9.1,  7.4,  5.5],
    "West": [6.6, 6., 5.2, 4.6, 6.5, 5.5, 4.5, 8.6, 10.7, 8.5, 6.1],
    "National": [5.6, 5.3, 4.3, 4.2, 5.8, 5.3, 4.6, 7.8, 9.1, 8., 5.7]
}

unemp_region = pd.DataFrame(data, index=years)
unemp_region
```

We can retrieve the index and the DataFrame values as we
did with a Series.

```{code-cell} python
unemp_region.index
```

```{code-cell} python
unemp_region.values
```

### What Can We Do with a DataFrame?

Pretty much everything we can do with a Series.

#### `.head` and `.tail`

As with Series, we can use `.head` and `.tail` to show only the
first or last `n` rows.

```{code-cell} python
unemp_region.head()
```

```{code-cell} python
unemp_region.tail(3)
```

#### Plotting

We can generate plots with the `.plot` method.

Notice we now have a separate line for each column of data.

```{code-cell} python
unemp_region.plot()
```

#### Indexing

We can also do indexing using `.loc`.

This is slightly more advanced than before because we can choose
subsets of both row and columns.

```{code-cell} python
unemp_region.loc[1995, "NorthEast"]
```

```{code-cell} python
unemp_region.loc[[1995, 2005], "South"]
```

```{code-cell} python
unemp_region.loc[1995, ["NorthEast", "National"]]
```

```{code-cell} python
unemp_region.loc[:, "NorthEast"]
```

```{code-cell} python
# `[string]` with no `.loc` extracts a whole column
unemp_region["MidWest"]
```

### Computations with Columns

pandas can do various computations and mathematical operations on
columns.

Let's take a look at a few of them.

```{code-cell} python
# Divide by 100 to move from percent units to a rate
unemp_region["West"] / 100
```

```{code-cell} python
# Find maximum
unemp_region["West"].max()
```

```{code-cell} python
# Find the difference between two columns
# Notice that pandas applies `-` to _all rows_ at once
# We'll see more of this throughout these materials
unemp_region["West"] - unemp_region["MidWest"]
```

```{code-cell} python
# Find correlation between two columns
unemp_region.West.corr(unemp_region["MidWest"])
```

```{code-cell} python
# find correlation between all column pairs
unemp_region.corr()
```

````{admonition} Exercise
:name: pd-int-dir2
See exercise 2 in the {ref}`exercise list <pd-int-ex>`.
````

## Data Types

We asked you to run the commands `unemp.dtype` and
`unemp_region.dtypes` and think about the outputs.

You might have guessed that they return the type of the values inside
each column.

Occasionally, you might need to investigate what types you have in your
DataFrame when an operation isn't behaving as expected.

```{code-cell} python
unemp.dtype
```

```{code-cell} python
unemp_region.dtypes
```

DataFrames will only distinguish between a few types.

- Booleans (`bool`)
- Floating point numbers (`float64`)
- Integers (`int64`)
- Dates (`datetime`) — we will learn this soon
- Categorical data (`categorical`)
- Everything else, including strings (`object`)

In the future, we will often refer to the type of data stored in a
column as its `dtype`.

Let's look at an example for when having an incorrect `dtype` can
cause problems.

Suppose that when we imported the data the `South` column was
interpreted as a string.

```{code-cell} python
str_unemp = unemp_region.copy()
str_unemp["South"] = str_unemp["South"].astype(str)
str_unemp.dtypes
```

Everything *looks* ok...

```{code-cell} python
str_unemp.head()
```

But if we try to do something like compute the sum of all the columns,
we get unexpected results...

```{code-cell} python
str_unemp.sum()
```

This happened because `.sum` effectively calls `+` on all rows in
each column.

Recall that when we apply `+` to two strings, the result is the two
strings concatenated.

So, in this case, we saw that the entries in all rows of the South
column were stitched together into one long string.

## Changing DataFrames

We can change the data inside of a DataFrame in various ways:

- Adding new columns
- Changing index labels or column names
- Altering existing data (e.g. doing some arithmetic or making a column
  of strings lowercase)

Some of these "mutations" will be topics of future lectures, so we will
only briefly discuss a few of the things we can do below.

### Creating New Columns

We can create new data by assigning values to a column similar to how
we assign values to a variable.

In pandas, we create a new column of a DataFrame by writing:

```{code-block} python
df["New Column Name"] = new_values
```

Below, we create an unweighted mean of the unemployment rate across the
four regions of the US — notice that this differs from the national
unemployment rate.

```{code-cell} python
unemp_region["UnweightedMean"] = (unemp_region["NorthEast"] +
                                  unemp_region["MidWest"] +
                                  unemp_region["South"] +
                                  unemp_region["West"])/4
```

```{code-cell} python
unemp_region.head()
```

### Changing Values

Changing the values inside of a DataFrame should be done sparingly.

However, it can be done by assigning a value to a location in the
DataFrame.

`df.loc[index, column] = value`

```{code-cell} python
unemp_region.loc[1995, "UnweightedMean"] = 0.0
```

```{code-cell} python
unemp_region.head()
```

### Renaming Columns

We can also rename the columns of a DataFrame, which is helpful because the names that sometimes come with datasets are
unbearable...

For example, the original name for the North East unemployment rate
given by the Bureau of Labor Statistics was `LASRD910000000000003`...

They have their reasons for using these names, but it can make our job
difficult since we often need to type it repeatedly.

We can rename columns by passing a dictionary to the `rename` method.

This dictionary contains the old names as the keys and new names as the
values.

See the example below.

```{code-cell} python
names = {"NorthEast": "NE",
         "MidWest": "MW",
         "South": "S",
         "West": "W"}
unemp_region.rename(columns=names)
```

```{code-cell} python
unemp_region.head()
```

We renamed our columns... Why does the DataFrame still show the old
column names?

Many pandas operations create a copy of your data by
default to protect your data and prevent you from overwriting
information you meant to keep.

We can make these operations permanent by either:

1. Assigning the output back to the variable name
   `df = df.rename(columns=rename_dict)`
1. Looking into whether the method has an `inplace` option. For
   example, `df.rename(columns=rename_dict, inplace=True)`

Setting `inplace=True` will sometimes make your code faster
(e.g. if you have a very large DataFrame and you don't want to copy all
the data), but that doesn't always happen.

We recommend using the first option until you get comfortable with
pandas because operations that don't alter your data are (usually)
safer.

```{code-cell} python
names = {"NorthEast": "NE",
         "MidWest": "MW",
         "South": "S",
         "West": "W"}

unemp_shortname = unemp_region.rename(columns=names)
unemp_shortname.head()
```
