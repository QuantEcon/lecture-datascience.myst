## Split-Apply-Combine

One powerful paradigm for analyzing data is the "Split-Apply-Combine"
strategy.

This strategy has three steps:

1. `Split`: split the data into groups based on values in one or more columns.
1. `Apply`: apply a function or routine to each group separately.
1. `Combine`: combine the output of the apply step into a DataFrame,
   using the group identifiers as the index.

We will cover the main components in this lecture, but we encourage you
to also study the [official
documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/groupby.html)
to learn more about what is possible.

To describe the concepts, we will need some data.

We will begin with a simple made-up dataset to discuss the concepts and
then work through extended example and exercises with real data.

```{code-cell} python
C = np.arange(1, 7, dtype=float)
C[[3, 5]] = np.nan
df = pd.DataFrame({
    "A" : [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2],
    "B" : [1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1],
    "C": C,
})
df
```

### Simple Example

To perform the *Split* step, we call the `groupby` method on our
DataFrame.

The first argument to `groupby` is a description of how we want to
construct groups.

In the most basic version, we will pass a string identifying the column
name.

```{code-cell} python
gbA = df.groupby("A")
```

The `type` of variable we get back is a `DataFrameGroupBy`, which we
will sometimes refer to as GroupBy for short.

```{code-cell} python
type(gbA)
```

Looking at the "groups" inside of the GroupBy object can help us
understand what the GroupBy represents.

We can do this with the `gb.get_group(group_name)` method.

```{code-cell} python
gbA.get_group(1)
```

```{code-cell} python
gbA.get_group(2)
```

We can *apply* some of our favorite aggregation functions directly on the
`GroupBy` object.

````{admonition} Exercise
:name: pd-grp-dir1
See exercise 1 in the {ref}`exercise list <pd-grp-ex>`.
````
````{admonition} Exercise
:name: pd-grp-dir2
See exercise 2 in the {ref}`exercise list <pd-grp-ex>`.
````


If we pass a list of strings to `groupby`, it will group based on
unique combinations of values from all columns in the list.

Let's see an example.

```{code-cell} python
gbAB = df.groupby(["A", "B"])
type(gbAB)
```

```{code-cell} python
gbAB.get_group((1, 1))
```

Notice that we still have a GroupBy object, so we can apply our favorite
aggregations.

```{code-cell} python
gbAB.count()
```

Notice that the output is a DataFrame with two levels on the index
and a single column `C`. (Quiz: how do we know it is a DataFrame with
one column and not a Series?)

This highlights a principle of how pandas handles the *Combine* part of
the strategy:

> The index of the combined DataFrame will be the group identifiers,
> with one index level per group key.

### Custom Aggregate Functions

So far, we have been applying built-in aggregations to our GroupBy object.

We can also apply custom aggregations to each group of a GroupBy in two
steps:

1. Write our custom aggregation as a Python function.
1. Passing our function as an argument to the `.agg` method of a GroupBy.

Let's see an example.

```{code-cell} python
def num_missing(df):
    "Return the number of missing items in each column of df"
    return df.isnull().sum()
```

We can call this function on our original DataFrame to get the number of
missing items in each column.

```{code-cell} python
num_missing(df)
```

We can also apply it to a GroupBy object to get the number of missing
items in each column *for each group*.

```{code-cell} python
gbA.agg(num_missing)
```

The key to keep in mind is that the function we pass to `agg` should
take in a DataFrame (or Series) and return a Series (or single value)
with one item per column in the original DataFrame.

When the function is called, the data for each group will be passed to
our function as a DataFrame (or Series).

### Transforms: The `apply` Method

As we saw in the {doc}`basics lecture <basics>`, we can apply transforms to DataFrames.

We can do the same with GroupBy objects using the `.apply` method.

Let's see an example.

```{code-cell} python
df
```

```{code-cell} python
def smallest_by_b(df):
    return df.nsmallest(2, "B")
```

```{code-cell} python
gbA.apply(smallest_by_b)
```

Notice that the return value from applying our series transform to `gbA`
was the group key on the outer level (the `A` column) and the original
index from `df` on the inner level.

The original index came along because that was the index of the
DataFrame returned by `smallest_by_b`.

Had our function returned something other than the index from `df`,
that would appear in the result of the call to `.apply`.

````{admonition} Exercise
:name: pd-grp-dir3
See exercise 3 in the {ref}`exercise list <pd-grp-ex>`.
````

### `pd.Grouper`

Sometimes, in order to construct the groups you want, you need to give
pandas more information than just a column name.

Some examples are:

- Grouping by a column and a level of the index.
- Grouping time series data at a particular frequency.

pandas lets you do this through the `pd.Grouper` type.

To see it in action, let's make a copy of `df` with `A` moved to the
index and a `Date` column added.

```{code-cell} python
df2 = df.copy()
df2["Date"] = pd.date_range(
    start=pd.datetime.today().strftime("%m/%d/%Y"),
    freq="BQ",
    periods=df.shape[0]
)
df2 = df2.set_index("A")
df2
```

We can group by year.

```{code-cell} python
df2.groupby(pd.Grouper(key="Date", freq="A")).count()
```

We can group by the `A` level of the index.

```{code-cell} python
df2.groupby(pd.Grouper(level="A")).count()
```

We can combine these to group by both.

```{code-cell} python
df2.groupby([pd.Grouper(key="Date", freq="A"), pd.Grouper(level="A")]).count()
```

And we can combine `pd.Grouper` with a string, where the string
denotes a column name

```{code-cell} python
df2.groupby([pd.Grouper(key="Date", freq="A"), "B"]).count()
```

## Case Study: Airline Delays

Let's apply our new split-apply-combine skills to the airline dataset we
saw in the {doc}`merge <merge>` lecture.

```{code-cell} python
url = "https://datascience.quantecon.org/assets/data/airline_performance_dec16.csv.zip"
air_dec = pd.read_csv(url, parse_dates = ['Date'])
```

First, we compute the average delay in arrival time for all carriers
each week.

```{code-cell} python
weekly_delays = (
    air_dec
    .groupby([pd.Grouper(key="Date", freq="W"), "Carrier"])
    ["ArrDelay"]               # extract one column
    .mean()                    # take average
    .unstack(level="Carrier")  # Flip carrier up as column names
)
weekly_delays
```

Let's also plot this data.

```{code-cell} python
# plot
axs = weekly_delays.plot.bar(
    figsize=(10, 8), subplots=True, legend=False, sharex=True,
    sharey=True, layout=(4, 3), grid=False
)

# tweak spacing between subplots and xaxis labels
axs[0,0].get_figure().tight_layout()
for ax in axs[-1, :]:
    ax.set_xticklabels(weekly_delays.index.strftime("%a, %b. %d'"))
```

It looks like more delays occurred during the week ending Sunday
December 18th than any other week (except for Frontier, who did *worse*
on Christmas week).

Let's see why.

The `air_dec` DataFrame has information on the minutes of delay
attributed to 5 different categories:

```{code-cell} python
delay_cols = [
    'CarrierDelay',
    'WeatherDelay',
    'NASDelay',
    'SecurityDelay',
    'LateAircraftDelay'
]
```

Let's take a quick look at each of those delay categories for the week ending December 18, 2016.

```{code-cell} python
pre_christmas = air_dec.loc[
    (air_dec["Date"] >= "2016-12-12") & (air_dec["Date"] <= "2016-12-18")
]

# custom agg function
def positive(df):
    return (df > 0).sum()

delay_totals = pre_christmas.groupby("Carrier")[delay_cols].agg(["sum", "mean", positive])
delay_totals
```

**Want**: plot total, average, and number of each type of delay by
carrier

To do this, we need to have a DataFrame with:

- Delay type in index (so it is on horizontal-axis)
- Aggregation method on *outer* most level of columns (so we can do
  `data["mean"]` to get averages)
- Carrier name on inner level of columns

Many sequences of the reshaping commands can accomplish this.

We show one example below.

```{code-cell} python
reshaped_delays = (
    delay_totals
    .stack()             # move aggregation method into index (with Carrier)
    .T                   # put delay type in index and Carrier+agg in column
    .swaplevel(axis=1)   # make agg method outer level of column label
    .sort_index(axis=1)  # sort column labels so it prints nicely
)
reshaped_delays
```

```{code-cell} python
for agg in ["mean", "sum", "positive"]:
    axs = reshaped_delays[agg].plot(
        kind="bar", subplots=True, layout=(4, 3), figsize=(10, 8), legend=False,
        sharex=True, sharey=True
    )
    fig = axs[0, 0].get_figure()
    fig.suptitle(agg)
#     fig.tight_layout();
```

````{admonition} Exercise
:name: pd-grp-dir4
See exercise 4 in the {ref}`exercise list <pd-grp-ex>`.
````

Let's summarize what we did:

- Computed average flight delay for each airline for each week.
- Noticed that one week had more delays for all airlines.
- Studied the flights in that week to determine the *cause* of the
  delays in that week.

Suppose now that we want to repeat that analysis, but at a daily
frequency instead of weekly.

We could copy/paste the code from above and change the `W` to a `D`,
but there's a better way...

Let's convert the steps above into two functions:

1. Produce the set of bar charts for average delays at each frequency.
1. Produce the second set of charts for the total, average, and number
   of occurrences of each type of delay.

```{code-cell} python
def mean_delay_plot(df, freq, figsize=(10, 8)):
    """
    Make a bar chart of average flight delays for each carrier at
    a given frequency.
    """
    mean_delays = (
        df
        .groupby([pd.Grouper(key="Date", freq=freq), "Carrier"])
        ["ArrDelay"]               # extract one column
        .mean()                    # take average
        .unstack(level="Carrier")  # Flip carrier up as column names
    )

    # plot
    axs = mean_delays.plot.bar(
        figsize=figsize, subplots=True, legend=False, sharex=True,
        sharey=True, layout=(4, 3), grid=False
    )

    # tweak spacing between subplots and x-axis labels
    axs[0, 0].get_figure().tight_layout()
    for ax in axs[-1, :]:
        ax.set_xticklabels(mean_delays.index.strftime("%a, %b. %d'"))

    # return the axes in case we want to further tweak the plot outside the function
    return axs


def delay_type_plot(df, start, end):
    """
    Make bar charts for total minutes, average minutes, and number of
    occurrences for each delay type, for all flights that were scheduled
    between `start` date and `end` date
    """
    sub_df = df.loc[
        (df["Date"] >= start) & (df["Date"] <= end)
    ]

    def positive(df):
        return (df > 0).sum()

    aggs = sub_df.groupby("Carrier")[delay_cols].agg(["sum", "mean", positive])

    reshaped = aggs.stack().T.swaplevel(axis=1).sort_index(axis=1)

    for agg in ["mean", "sum", "positive"]:
        axs = reshaped[agg].plot(
            kind="bar", subplots=True, layout=(4, 3), figsize=(10, 8), legend=False,
            sharex=True, sharey=True
        )
        fig = axs[0, 0].get_figure()
        fig.suptitle(agg)
#         fig.tight_layout();
```

````{admonition} Exercise
:name: pd-grp-dir5
See exercise 5 in the {ref}`exercise list <pd-grp-ex>`.
````

Now let's look at that plot at a daily frequency. (Note that we need the
figure to be a bit wider in order to see the dates.)

```{code-cell} python
mean_delay_plot(air_dec, "D", figsize=(16, 8));
```

As we expected given our analysis above, the longest average delays
seemed to happen in the third week.

In particular, it looks like December 17th and 18th had — on average —
higher delays than other days in December.

Let's use the `delay_type_plot` function to determine the cause of the
delays on those two days.

Because our analysis is captured in a single function, we can look at
the days together and separately without much effort.

```{code-cell} python
# both days
delay_type_plot(air_dec, "12-17-16", "12-18-16")
```

```{code-cell} python
# only the 17th
delay_type_plot(air_dec, "12-17-16", "12-17-16")
```

```{code-cell} python
# only the 18th
delay_type_plot(air_dec, "12-18-16", "12-18-16")
```

The purpose of this exercise was to drive home the ability to *automate*
tasks.

We were able to write a pair of `functions` that allows us to easily
repeat the exact same analysis on different subsets of the data, or
different datasets entirely (e.g. we could do the same analysis on
November 2016 data, with two lines of code).

These principles can be applied in many settings.

Keep that in mind as we work through the rest of the materials.

## Exercise: Cohort Analysis using Shopify Data

The `qeds` library includes routines to simulate data sets in the
format of common sources

One of these sources is [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) — an
e-commerce platform used by many retail companies for online sales

The code below will simulate a fairly large data set that has the
properties of a order-detail report from Shopify

We'll first look at the data, and then describe the exercise

```{code-cell} python
# Set the "randomness" seeds
random.seed(42)
np.random.seed(42)

url = "https://datascience.quantecon.org/assets/data/shopify_orders.csv.zip"
orders = pd.read_csv(url)
orders.info()

orders.head()
```

We define a customer's cohort as the month in which a customer placed
their first order and the customer type as an indicator of whether this
was their first order or a returning order.

We now describe the *want* for the exercise, which we ask you to
complete.

**Want**: Compute the monthly total number of orders, total sales, and
total quantity separated by customer cohort and customer type.

Read that carefully one more time...

### Extended Exercise

Using the reshape and `groupby` tools you have learned, apply the want
operator described above.

See below for advice on how to proceed.

When you are finished, you should have something that looks like this:

```{figure} ../_static/groupby_cohort_analysis_exercise_output.png
:alt: groupby\_cohort\_analysis\_exercise\_output.png
```

Two notes on the table above:

Your actual output will be much bigger. This is just to give you an
: idea of what it might look like.

The numbers you produce should actually be the same as what are
: included in this table... Index into your answer and compare what you
  have with this table to verify your progress.



Now, how to do it?

There is more than one way to code this, but here are some suggested
steps.

1. Convert the `Day` column to have a `datetime` `dtype` instead
   of object.
    - ```{hint}
      Use the `pd.to_datetime` function.
      ```
1. Add a new column that specifies the date associated with each
   customer's `"First-time"` order.
    - ```{hint}
      You can do this with a combination of `groupby` and
      `join`.
      ```
    - ```{hint}
      `customer_type` is always one of `Returning` and `First-time`.
      ```
    - ```{hint}
      Some customers don't have a `customer_type == "First-time"` entry. You will need to set the
      value for these users to some date that precedes the dates in the
      sample. After adding valid data back into `orders` DataFrame,
      you can identify which customers don't have a `"First-Time"`
      entry by checking for missing data in the new column.
      ```
1. You'll need to group by 3 things.
1. You can apply one of the built-in aggregation functions to the GroupBy.
1. After doing the aggregation, you'll need to use your reshaping skills to
   move things to the right place in rows and columns.

Good luck!

## Exercises

### Exercise 1

Look closely at the output of the cells below.

How did pandas compute the sum of `gbA`? What happened to the `NaN`
entries in column `C`?

Write your thoughts.

```{hint}
Try `gbA.count()` or `gbA.mean()` if you can't decide what
happened to the `NaN`.
```

```{code-cell} python
:tags: ["remove-output"]
df
```

```{code-cell} python
:tags: ["remove-output"]
gbA.sum()
```

### Exercise 2

Use introspection (tab completion) to see what other aggregations are
defined for GroupBy objects.

Pick three and evaluate them in the cells below.

Does the output of each of these commands have the same features as the
output of `gbA.sum()` from above? If not, what is different?

```{code-cell} python
# method 1
```

```{code-cell} python
# method 2
```

```{code-cell} python
# method 3
```

({ref}`back to text <pd-grp-dir2>`)

### Exercise 3

```{note} 
This exercise has a few steps:
```

1. Write a function that, given a DataFrame, computes each entry's
deviation from the mean of its column.
2. Apply the function to `gbA`.
3. With your neighbor describe what the index and and columns are? Where
are the group keys (the `A` column)?
4. Determine the correct way to add these results back into `df` as
new columns. 
    - ```{hint}
      Remember the {doc}`merge<merge>` lecture.
      ```

```{code-cell} python
# write function here


# apply function here
```

```{code-cell} python
# add output of function as new columns to df here...
```

Note that if the group keys remained in the index as the `.apply`'s output, the merge/join step would have been complicated.

({ref}`back to text <pd-grp-dir3>`)

### Exercise 4

Think about what is shown in the the plots above.

Answer questions like:

- Which type of delay was the most common?
- Which one caused the largest average delay?
- Does that vary by airline?

Write your thoughts.

```{code-cell} python
# your code here if needed
```

({ref}`back to text <pd-grp-dir4>`)

### Exercise 5

Verify that we wrote the functions properly by setting the arguments to
appropriate values to replicate the plots from above.

```{code-cell} python
# call mean_delay_plot here
```

```{code-cell} python
# call delay_type_plot here
```
