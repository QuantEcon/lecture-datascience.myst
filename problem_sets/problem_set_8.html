<h1>Problem Set 8<a class="headerlink" href="#problem-set-8" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>In this problem set, your goal is to train a model to best predict
log housing values. The criteria for best prediction is mean squared error.
The file ahs.csv contains data from the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/ahs.html">American Housing
Survey</a> . Your predictive model will be
graded based on another evaluation sample from the same survey.
You should create a function that returns the predictions of your model
when given an identically-formatted csv file with all the same variables.
(Your function should not refit your model on the evaluation sample.)
In addition, answer the questions below.</p>
<section id="additional-rules">
<h2>Additional Rules<a class="headerlink" href="#additional-rules" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>You may not use additional data from the American Housing Survey to
fit your model. You may use data from other sources (although this
is not necessary to receive a good grade). You may use methods not
covered in this course (although this is also not necessary to receive
a good grade).</p>
