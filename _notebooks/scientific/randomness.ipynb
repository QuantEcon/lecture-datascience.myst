    "### Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we learn how to use Python to generate randomness, we should make sure\n",
    "that we all agree on some basic concepts of probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "To think about the probability of some event occurring, we must understand what possible\n",
    "events could occur – mathematicians refer to this as the *event space*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples are\n",
    "\n",
    "- For a coin flip, the coin could either come up heads, tails, or land on its side.  \n",
    "- The inches of rain falling in a certain location on a given day could be any real\n",
    "  number between 0 and $ \\infty $.  \n",
    "- The change in an S&P500 stock price could be any real number between\n",
    "  $ - $ opening price and $ \\infty $.  \n",
    "- An individual’s employment status tomorrow could either be employed or unemployed.  \n",
    "- And the list goes on…  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that in some of these cases, the event space can be counted (coin flip and employment status)\n",
    "while in others, the event space cannot be counted (rain and stock prices).\n",
    "\n",
    "We refer to random variables with countable event spaces as *discrete random variables* and\n",
    "random variables with uncountable event spaces as *continuous random variables*.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then call certain numbers ‘probabilities’ and associate them with events from the event space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is true about probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The probability of any event must be greater than or equal to 0.  \n",
    "1. The probability of all events from the event space must sum (or integrate) to 1.  \n",
    "1. If two events cannot occur at same time, then the probability that at least one of them occurs is\n",
    "  the sum of the probabilities that each event occurs (known as independence).  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We won’t rely on these for much of what we learn in this class, but occasionally, these facts will\n",
    "help us reason through what is happening."
