    "## Introduction to Recidivism\n",
    "\n",
    "Recidivism is the tendency for an individual who has previously committed a crime to commit another crime\n",
    "in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "One key input to a judge’s sentencing decision is how likely a given convict is to re-offend, or recidivate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an effort to assist the legal system with sentencing guidelines, data scientists have attempted\n",
    "to predict an individual’s risk of recidivism from known observables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some are concerned that this process may exhibit prejudice, either through biased inputs\n",
    "or through statistical discrimination.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Biased inputs: Imagine that a judge often writes harsher sentences to people of a particular race or gender. If an algorithm is trained to reproduce the sentences of this judge, the bias will be propagated by the algorithm.  \n",
    "1. Statistical discrimination: Imagine that two variables (say race and income) are correlated, and one of them (say income) is correlated with the risk of recidivism. If income is unobserved, then an otherwise unbiased method would discriminate based on race, even if race has nothing to say about recidivism after controlling for income.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This has given rise to serious discussions about the moral obligations data scientists have to\n",
    "those who are affected by their tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will not take a stance today on our moral obligations, but we believe this is an important\n",
    "precursor to any statistical work with public policy applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "One predictive tool used by various courts in the United States is\n",
    "called COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be following a [Pro Publica](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing)\n",
    "article that analyzes the output of COMPAS.\n",
    "\n",
    "The findings of the article include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Black defendants were often predicted to be at a higher risk of recidivism than they actually were.  \n",
    "- White defendants were often predicted to be less risky than they were.  \n",
    "- Black defendants were twice as likely as white defendants to be misclassified as being a higher\n",
    "  risk of violent recidivism.  \n",
    "- Even when controlling for prior crimes, future recidivism, age, and gender, black defendants were\n",
    "  77 percent more likely to be assigned higher risk scores than white defendants.  "
