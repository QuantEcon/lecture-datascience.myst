    "In this case, that is not a surprise. In his original study, Wayne Zachary collected this network dataset from a set of two warring karate clubs in the same area. He collected information about who each individual member would spend the most time with, used that data to construct a graph, and found that the disconnect between clubs persisted into their social networks. Using the spectrum of this graph, we can learn that there are two easily disconnected groups in the network, without ever hearing this backstory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In social networks, this type of homophily is universally bad. Not only normatively, but also quantitatively. Economic research, beginning with a 2012 study by Benjamin Golub and Matthew Jackson, has shown that the size of this spectral homophily gives an indication of how fast information spreads through a social network. If the Fiedler value is very large, it indicates that the network structure will be effective at spreading information quickly. If the value is close to zero, on the other hand, new information may take a very long time to diffuse through the network, because it can take a long time for information starting in the red area to spread to the blue area and vice versa. (If you have any prior exposure to ordinary differential equations, this connection between eigenvalues and dynamics may not come as a huge surprise. In fact the laplacian matrix has a satisfying interpretation as describing diffusion processes over a network, which can explain a lot about it’s spectral properties.)\n",

    "Forming a network based on this simple method, and looking at its spectrum, was enough to cleanly identify both of the sectors in our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "We were able to identify a cluster of technology stocks (the red nodes, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and Apple) as being distinct from the stocks in the financial services sector (purple nodes, Citibank, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Visa), without using any information about their names or what they do. Now you can pick 2 stocks for your boss, and be confident that you are recommending a diverse portfolio that spans multiple sectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "This highlights a few important closing points. We obtained this network by looking at a correlation matrix and sparsifying the network by arbitrarily choosing to treat correlations more than 0.92 as being links, and ignoring those with a correlation of less than 0.92. But there are *infinite* ways that we could have formed this network, for example, by choosing any other real value between 0 and 1 (which would change the density), by keeping all of the correlations and building a **weighted** network, by only forming links from one stock to the three most highly correlated others (by **k-nearest-neighbors** or **KNN**), or even by using a different distance metric than correlation entirely. For example, you could even build a network with links between companies whose names share a letter. Even though that is a perfectly valid network, it might not be the most informative choice in this particular setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, an important lesson to take away from this exercise is that a network can be used to represent basically any kind of data. This gives them the potential to be a powerful and convenient tool to understand underlying relational structure in a dataset. Often however, it comes down to the data scientist to understand *which* networks contain the information they need. Even using this very limited information about extreme correlations, we were able to use spectral clustering to correctly identify the two distinct sectors that comprise our dataset based only on their weekly returns. A worthwhile exercise, whenever you are faced with this choice, is to try forming the network in a bunch of different ways. If you get the same results, that’s great! Otherwise, you might need to take a step back and think more carefully about what types of relationships are relevant for the problem you are interested in."
