    "## Introduction to Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "We now move from regression to the second main branch of machine learning:\n",
    "classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the regression problem mapped a set of\n",
    "feature variables to a continuous target.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification is similar to regression, but instead of predicting a continuous\n",
    "target, classification algorithms attempt to apply one (or more) of a discrete\n",
    "number of labels or classes to each observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another perspective is that for regression, the targets are usually\n",
    "continuous-valued, while in classification, the targets are categorical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common examples of classification problems are\n",
    "\n",
    "- Labeling emails as spam or not spam  \n",
    "- Person identification in a photo  \n",
    "- Speech recognition  \n",
    "- Whether or not a country is or will be in a recession  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification can also be applied in settings where the target isn’t naturally\n",
    "categorical.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we want to predict whether the unemployment rate for a state\n",
    "will be low ($ <3\\% $), medium ($ \\in [3\\%, 5\\%] $), or high ($ >5\\% $)\n",
    "but don’t care about the actual number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most economic problems are posed in continuous terms, so it may take some creativity\n",
    "to determine the optimal way to categorize a target variable so\n",
    "classification algorithms can be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "As many problems can be posed either as classification or regression, many\n",
    "machine learning algorithms have variants that perform regression or\n",
    "classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this lecture, we will revisit some of the algorithms from the\n",
    "[regression](https://datascience.quantecon.org/regression.html) lecture and discuss how they can be applied in\n",
    "classification settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have already seen relatives of these algorithms, this lecture will be\n",
    "lighter on exposition and then build up to an application."
