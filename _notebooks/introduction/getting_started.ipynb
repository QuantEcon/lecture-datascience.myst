    "\n",
    "Among the hundreds of programming languages to choose from, we chose to teach you Python for the\n",
    "following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Easy to learn and use (relative to other programming languages).  \n",
    "- Designed with readability in mind.  \n",
    "- Excellent tools for handling data efficiently and succinctly.  \n",
    "- Cemented as the world’s [third most popular](https://www.zdnet.com/article/programming-language-of-the-year-python-is-standout-in-latest-rankings/)\n",
    "  programming language, the most popular scripting language, and an increasing standard for\n",
    "  [data analysis in industry](https://medium.com/@data_driven/python-vs-r-for-data-science-and-the-winner-is-3ebb1a968197).  \n",
    "- General purpose: Initially you will learn Python for data analysis, but it\n",
    "  can also used for websites, database management, web scraping, financial\n",
    "  modeling, data visualization, etc.  In particular, it is the world’s best language for\n",
    "  [gluing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glue_code)  those different pieces together.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the general purpose nature of Python comes at a cost: it is often said that Python is “the\n",
    "best language for nothing but the second best language for everything”.\n",
    "\n",
    "We aren’t sure this is true, but a more optimistic view of that quote is that Python is a great\n",
    "language to have in your toolbox to solve all sorts of problems and patch them together.\n",
    "\n",
    "A versatile “second-best” language might be the best one to learn first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other languages to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "- R has an impressive ecosystem of statistical packages, and is defensible as a choice for pure\n",
    "  data science. It could be a useful second language to learn for projects that are entirely\n",
    "  statistical.  \n",
    "- Matlab has much more natural notation for writing linear algebra heavy code.  However, it is:\n",
    "  (a) expensive; (b) poor at dealing with data analysis; (c) grossly inferior to Python as a\n",
    "  language; and (d) being left behind as Python and Julia ecosystems expand to more packages.  \n",
    "- Julia is in part a far better version of Matlab, which can be as fast as Fortran or C.  However,\n",
    "  it has a young and immature environment and is currently more appropriate for academics and\n",
    "  scientific computing specialists.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Another consideration for programming language choice is runtime performance. On this dimension,\n",
    "Python, R, and Matlab can be slow for certain types of tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, this will not be an issue for data science and the types of analysis we will do in this\n",
    "course, because most of the data analytics packages in Python (and R) rely on high-performance\n",
    "code written in other languages in the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are writing more traditional scientific/technical computing in Python, there are\n",
    "[things that can help](http://numba.pydata.org/) make Python faster in some situations,\n",
    "but another language like Julia may be a better fit."
