    "We then present two potential environments for working through this course material:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A cloud environment in which computations are performed remotely on the cloud and you interact\n",
    "  with this remote computer through your browser.  \n",
    "1. A local environment in which you install the appropriate software and all interactions are with\n",

    "At the end of this section, we hope you understand what you’d like to accomplish with these lectures\n",
