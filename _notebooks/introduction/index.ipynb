    "We will describe our goals and objectives.\n",

    "We will then talk about what a programming language is, how computers use them to do operations, and\n",
    "why we have chosen the Python language.\n",

    "We then present two potential environments for working through this course material:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A cloud environment in which computations are performed remotely on the cloud and you interact\n",
    "  with this remote computer through your browser.  \n",
    "1. A local environment in which you install the appropriate software and all interactions are with\n",
    "  your own computer.  \n",

    "At the end of this section, we hope you understand what youâ€™d like to accomplish with these lectures\n",
    "and that you are able to start and use a Jupyter notebook."
