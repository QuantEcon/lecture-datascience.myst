    "### Scope of Lecture Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "This course is a lecture series on data science, economics, programming, and how\n",
    "they can be used to understand the world around us.\n",
    "\n",
    "We envision this as a complement to econometrics. We focus on learning practical programming\n",
    "skills for the workplace and future studies in economics and finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike courses in computer science, data science, or statistics, the emphasis of this course\n",
    "includes both the programming and the statistics necessary to analyze data *and* subsequently\n",
    "interpret results through the lens of economics.\n",
    "\n",
    "While anyone with the appropriate prerequisites will benefit from this course, undergraduate\n",
    "programs will find the lecture series suitable for 2nd to 3rd year students who have taken two\n",
    "calculus classes and their school’s equivalent of Econ 101. No prior programming experience is\n",
    "required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Students who complete this course will be prepared to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Work in a data analyst or a data science role with the ability to frame problems in a broader\n",
    "  economic context and provide unique insights associated with that context, and/or,  \n",
    "- Continue onto QuantEcon’s “Lectures in Quantitative Economics” in preparation for graduate school\n",
    "  in economics, policy, or other related fields.  \n",

    "To get an idea of what one can do after taking this course, please take a look at [previous student projects](https://datascience.quantecon.org/../theme/projects.html)."

    "\n",
    "This provides a natural introduction to thinking of economics as a quantitative discipline, with\n",
    "principles and applications grounded in real world problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second segment dives into data analysis and data science, with the associated data wrangling\n",
    "skills, as a way to leverage economic data, tools, and concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final segment is a sequence of case studies designed to help students answer specific questions\n",
    "and recommend solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Students will learn and apply more advanced techniques and models, as well as examine new data sources."
