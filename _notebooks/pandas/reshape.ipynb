    "While pushed more generally in the `R` language, the concept of “[tidy data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidy_data)” is helpful in understanding the\n",
    "objectives for reshaping data, which in turn makes advanced features like\n",

    "> A dataset is a collection of values, usually either numbers (if quantitative) or strings (if qualitative). Values are organized in two ways. Every value belongs to a variable and an observation. A variable contains all values that measure the same underlying attribute (like height, temperature, duration) across units. An observation contains all values measured on the same unit (like a person, or a day, or a race) across attributes. – [Tidy Data (Journal of Statistical Software 2013)](https://www.jstatsoft.org/index.php/jss/article/view/v059i10/v59i10.pdf)\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Each variable forms a column.  \n",

    "what uniquely identifies an “observation” in your data.\n",

    "Is it a country? A year? A combination of country and year?\n",
    "\n",

    "by the uniqueness of the index.\n",
    "\n",
    "When considering how to map this to the social sciences, note that\n",
    "reshaping data can change what we consider to be the variable and\n",

    "\n",
    "For example, if the “observation” uniquely identified by a country and year and\n",

    "A word of caution: The tidy approach, where there is no redundancy and each\n",
