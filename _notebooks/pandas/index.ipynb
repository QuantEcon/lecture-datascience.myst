    "manipulation, analysis, and visualization in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "We build on the skills learned in the [Python fundamentals](https://datascience.quantecon.org/../python_fundamentals/index.html) section and teach the\n",
    "[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) library.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this section, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Access data stored in a variety of formats  \n",
    "- Combine multiple datasets based on observations that link them\n",
    "  together  \n",
    "- Perform custom operations on tables of data  \n",
    "- Use the split-apply-combine method for analyzing sub-groups of data  \n",
    "- Automate static analysis on changing data  \n",
    "- Produce publication quality visualizations  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, our goal with this section is to provide you the\n",
    "necessary skills to – at a minimum – **immediately** replicate your current\n",
    "data analysis workflow in Python with no loss of total (computer +\n",
